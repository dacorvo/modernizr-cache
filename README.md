# modernizr-cache

A simple PHP script that allows [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) feature detection code to be run only once in a browsing session.

This script is inspired by [modernizr-server](https://github.com/jamesgpearce/modernizr-server) by James G. Pearce.

Usage: Just include the modernizr-cache.php file as follows:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="./modernizr-cache.php"></script>
